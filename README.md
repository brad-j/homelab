# üè† Homelab

[![Project Status: Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-Active-green.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/homelab)

This repository contains all the code, configuration, and documentation for my personal homelab setup. As a passionate tech enthusiast and tinkerer, this project began when I repurposed my old gaming PC with Proxmox, transforming it into a powerful home server.

## üåü Overview

My homelab serves as both a learning platform and a playground where I:

- üõ†Ô∏è Self-host various applications and services
- üè° Manage home automation through Home Assistant
- üéÆ Experiment with virtualization and containerization
- üì∫ Run a complete media server stack
