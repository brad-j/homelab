# üè† Homelab

This repository contains all the code, configuration, and documentation for my personal homelab setup. This project began when I repurposed my old gaming PC, transforming it into a home server with Proxmox.

## Overview

My homelab serves as both a learning platform and a playground where I:

- üõ†Ô∏è Self-host various applications and services
- üè° Manage home automation through Home Assistant
- üéÆ Experiment with virtualization and containerization
- üì∫ Run a complete media server stack
